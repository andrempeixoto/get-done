# GET DONE

This my first (Vanilla) JavaScript webapp. It is a To-Do list that was developed based on
Rocketseat's Starter Course.

It is hosted at [andrempeixoto.github.io/get-done](https://andrempeixoto.github.io/get-done) and it
is free to use. The current version is 2.1.

All data is stored in your browser's local storage and the server doesn't store any information
entered.
